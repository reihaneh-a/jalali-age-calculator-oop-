Person Age Calculator
This is a simple Python program that calculates a person’s age using their birth year in the Jalali (Persian) calendar. The program provides an easy-to-use Person class that takes a person's name and birth year and calculates their age using the current Jalali year.

How It Works
The program defines a Person class with a constructor that accepts the name and birth year of a person.
Using the jdatetime library, the program calculates the person’s age based on the current year in the Jalali calendar.
The display method and __str__ method both return a formatted string showing the person’s name and calculated age.
